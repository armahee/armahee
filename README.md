I am professional software engineer expert in data structure and algorithm. Because I started competitive programming in 2017 and continued for 4 years.
During this time I learned very difficult data structure and algorithm in C++ and python language. Because of competition I increased my coding time and
accuracy within this time. I started website development in 2018. So it been 4 years in website development. Because of a strong knowledge about programming
languages it was very easy to switch in any language for me. In the beginning I started with basic raw languages like javascript and php. After that since 2019 I
learned many modern and standard framework for those languages. Now I am expert in React JS, Vue JS, Angular JS of javascript framework and Express JS
of Node JS. And Also expert in Laravel framework of PHP. So it been 3 years of experience in these frameworks.
